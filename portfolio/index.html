                <p>My name is Emily Horton. I am a computer scientist who specializes in
                    gameplay programming for video games. I love to engage with challenging
                    coding problems that requrie clever design to solve.<br><br>In my spare
                    time, I enjoy playing games, going on hikes, and spending time with my
                    loved ones.
