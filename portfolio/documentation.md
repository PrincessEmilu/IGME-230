# IGME 230 Portfolio Documentation

## Resources

Currently I am using three Google Fonts. Open Sans for most text, Lobster for various headings, and VT323 for my stylized welcome.

More info to come as will be appropriate.

## Inspiration

As per the project requirements, I wanted to make a website layout that would make sense for what I specialize in and what would appeal to potential employers. A portfolio should communicate who I am and showcase my best work.

Because I love coding and video games, I figured I could go for a playful look that communicates aesthetically that I'm interested in video games and that I write code.
