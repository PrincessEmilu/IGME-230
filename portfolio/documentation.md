# IGME 230 Portfolio Documentation

## Resources

Currently I am using three Google Fonts. Open Sans for most text, Lobster for various headings, and VT323 for my stylized welcome.

More info to come as will be appropriate.

## Inspiration

As per the project requirements, I wanted to make a website layout that would make sense for what I specialize in and what would appeal to potential employers. A portfolio should communicate who I am and showcase my best work.

Because I love coding and video games, I figured I could go for a playful look that communicates aesthetically that I'm interested in video games and that I write code.

## How?

I made this website from scratch. I found that making the javascript properly show/hide descriptions for each project was a little more complicated than I first thought. I hadn't considered the fact that there are a variable amount of images and that hte images being displayed will change based on the size of the screen.
Thus, I had to re-create the javascript a couple of times, but in the end it was a pretty simple solution. I understand that frameworks may have done some of this work for me, but I did not take the time to learn a new frame work and decided that for a simple site design I would just stick with what I know how to do.

Personally, I think that the simple yet thoughtful aesthetic design of the site is its best quality. The color scheme is basic, inoffensive, and thematically consistent to the material I'm including on the page. I only regret not starting on this project sooner so that I could expand on the basic concepts and make this idea shine.
