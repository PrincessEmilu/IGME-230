# Queen  
## High Concept
As Queen of The Hive, wield total control over your minions as you build your empire and assimilate the
planet; It is good to be Queen.
## Genre
*Queen* is a cross between an idle game and a simmulation. Think *Clicker Heroes* meets
building an economy as the Zerg from *StarCraft*.
## Platform  
This game will be designed for web browsers on desktop computers.
## Story  
As the Queen of a hive-mind species, your goal is to grow your horde of minions and dominate the planet,
either wiping-out or assimilating other life forms on your conquest.  

The player will feel the power of commanding a large force of minions as they lead a seemingly-unstoppable
force of parasites to planetary domination. *Queen* will aim to insinuate the feeling of power-lust into its
players. After all, the goal of most idle games is to keep growing your economy and your power to increasingly
absurd heights.  

However, *Queen* will also show the effects of your conquest through minute story events that are triggered as
the player progresses and reaches new milestones. For example, when you have enough resources and minion to attempt
a hostile takeover of a whole town, descriptive messages about how people resist you or beg for mercy will appear.
Ideally, the player will enjoy the power they gain, but question their own moralitythe game will make them consider
the ethics of their own power-grab.
