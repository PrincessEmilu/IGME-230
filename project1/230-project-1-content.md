# Queen   

  

## High Concept 

As Queen of The Hive, you wield total control over your minions as you build your empire and assimilate the 

planet. 

  

## Genre 

*Queen* is a cross between an incremental game and a simulation. Think *Clicker Heroes* meets 

building an economy as the Zerg from *StarCraft*. 

  

## Platform   

This game will be designed for web browsers on desktop computers. 

  

## Story   

Deep in a long-forgotten laboratory, the Queen sleeps. Years ago, the scientists who engineered her lost control of her and destroyed the lab, taking down her and her unfortunate victims with her- or so everyone believed. How long she has been sleeping, she couldn't say, but she is roused by the scent of food and- more importantly- an opportunity. 

  

The player starts out by latching onto a single rat that happened to pass by them. As the fallen queen, the player will grow an army and expand to other lifeforms with the aim of eventual world domination.   

  

As the player advances and builds their economy, the queen's power lust becomes their own. The prospect of conquest and domination will encourage the player to move forward and see just how far they can get. *Queen*'s aim is to encourage the player to consume and control other life forms. On the surface, this is presented a positive goal; however, the player will question their actions as they wreak havoc on other life forms and rob them of their free will. Though the player starts out infecting rats, they will move to infecting higher-order life forms that the average person might feel more empathy towards, such as dogs or humans. The game narrative will be told through the upgrade and expansion options the player gains as they continue to build their empire.  

  

## Esthetics   

*Queen* will use vector graphics that aim to look simple and stylistic. 

  

The game will have basic sound effects for menu interaction as well as context-specific sounds for more dramatic actions, such as spawning a new minion or sacrificing a host for its resources. 

  

The scope of the in-game world that the player interacts with will be changing in stages. To reinforce this sense of growth, there will be a single ambient background track that is simple in the earlier stages but will increase in complexity with more instruments and a longer loop. Each stage should help set the tone for the player's progression on the quest for world dominance. 

  

## Gameplay   

  

### Mechanics   

The player will have to make choices in how the harvest and spend their accumulated resources in order to create a steady 

economy and expand their empire. The game leverages the Achievement mechanic to award a sense of progress. The next upgrade will always be right around the corner for the player- all they need to do is continue with their momentum of harvesting resources and being "blissfully productive".    

  

The economy can be summarized into four main categories: Hosts, Minions, Currency, and Mutations. At the start of the game, the player will simply be gathering one currency- nutrients- from a single host. However, nutrients can be spent on producing more minions (at the lowest stage, this will be nutrient-sucking ticks). Eventually, the player will need to attach to new hosts because individual hosts have a maximum parasite capacity. Taking over a new host will use minions as a form of currency- for example, capturing a new rat might cost 50 ticks due to the resistance the host puts up to oncoming parasites. 

  

In a similar vein, hosts themselves can be sacrificed for a new form of currency, protein. Protein will be used in conjunction with nutrients to purchase mutations, which are essentially modifiers to the species' ability to attack hosts, harvest nutrients, and reproduce. Mutations will be relatively costly and will be upgradable multiple times for even bigger benefits.

### Controls   

This game will be controlled exclusively with the mouse. Most of the game will be clicking on buttons and navigating 

various menus or directing a graphical representation of your minions on screen.  

  

### Onboarding   

The player will be presented with a very simple menu interface with only one option- click a button to harvest nutrients from the host. 

After the player has harvested enough nutrients, a new menu option to spawn a minion will appear. The player will see a graphical representation of their progress as they gather resources and produce more minions- their newly spawned minions will appear next to them and clicking to harvest nutrients will cause both the player character and the minions to harvest nutrients. This progression will be based on cascading information theory; new upgrades, choices, and information will be presented to the player only as they are unlocked and become relevant to progression. This way, the player will always have an obvious "next action" to work toward and teaching the game will be baked right into its presentation. 

  

### Player Learning 

In order to be successful in *Queen*, the player needs to make decisions on building their economy and upgrading their species. There isn't necessarily a way to lose in this game, but progression towards end-game of assimilating the whole planet will take inefficient players much longer to accomplish. 

  

At its core, *Queen* follows a path of linear improvements that have exponentially increasing costs, as most incremental games do. Although the diminishing returns on repeatable upgrades may be initially obvious to the player, the gradual introduction of additional currencies and multiple vectors will make the optimal strategy ambiguous and encourage the player to explore and experiment. 

  

As stated earlier, the game begins with harvesting nutrient and growing an army of ticks. Tick growth, however, will be limited by how many hosts the player currently is infecting. The ability to infect a new host will not be introduced to the player until they start to get close to their current limit, at which point the player will be presented with two new menu sections, one for buying mutations and the other for buying or sacrificing hosts. The player will see that they can't buy upgrades yet because they cost protein, a currency they haven't encountered yet. On the host screen, the player will see they can buy a new host, which will cost them some of their minions. When they buy a host, the player will also be shown a new button- sacrifice host. This progression will express to the player that they have a way of obtaining protein through sacrificing a host, but hosts come with an opportunity cost of lost minions (and a lower growth cap). 

  

Although buying a new host will set the player back at first, they will see that they can also sacrifice a host to earn enough protein to buy mutations, which will increase their production. This cycle of temporary setbacks and changing caps on player growth will be the crux of the game and will present the element of choice to players. 

  

There will be three main mutations that modify the production cycle- Harvest Efficiency, Spawning Cost, and Automatic Harvesting. Harvest Efficiency increases the nutrients gained per click; Spawning Cost reduces the cost to spawn new minions, and Automatic Harvesting will allow resources to be gained over time in addition to per-click. All of these upgrades will cost protein, meaning that they will require multiple cycles of growth and sacrifice. 

  

Upgrade and minion costs will grow exponentially, while growth increase will advance linearly. Although it will be up to the player what they decide to upgrade first, as well as when they think upgrades are necessary, the Harvest Efficiency mutation will probably be their first priority. Used in conjunction with Spawning Cost, the player can start to farm protein much faster, which will allow them to start investing in Automatic Harvesting much faster.
