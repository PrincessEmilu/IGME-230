# Queen  

## High Concept
As Queen of The Hive, you wield total control over your minions as you build your empire and assimilate the
planet.

## Genre
*Queen* is a cross between an idle game and a simmulation. Think *Clicker Heroes* meets
building an economy as the Zerg from *StarCraft*.

## Platform  
This game will be designed for web browsers on desktop computers.

## Story  
Deep in a long-forgotten laboratory, the Queen sleeps. Years ago, the scientists who engineered her lost control of her and destroyed the lab, taking down her and her unforutnate victims with her- or so everyone believed. How long she has been sleeping, she couldn't say, but she is roused by the scent of food and- more importantly- an opportunity.

The player starts out by latching onto a single rat that happened to pass by them. As the fallen queen, the player will grow an army and expand to other lifeforms with the aim of eventual world domination.  

As the player advances and builds their economy, the queen's powerlust becomes their own. The prospect of conquest and domination will encourage the player to move forward and see just how far they can get. *Queen*'s aim is to encourage the player to consume and control other life forms. On the surface, this is presented a positive goal; however, the player will question their actions as they wreak havoc on other life forms and rob them of their free will. Though the player starts out infecting rats, they will move to infecting higher-order life forms that the average person might feel more empathy towards, such as dogs or humans. The game narative will be told through the upgrade and expansion options the player gains as they continue to build their empire. 

## Esthetics  
*Queen* will use vector graphics that aim to look simple and stylistic.

The game will have basic sound effects for menu interaction as well as context-specific sounds for more dramatic actions, such as spawning a new minion or sacrificing a host for its resources.

The scope of the in-game world that the player interacts with will be changing in stages. To reinforce this sense of growth, there will be a single ambient background track that is simple in the earlier stages, but will increase in complexity with more instruments and a longer loop. Each stage should help set the tone for the player's progression on the quest for world dominance.

## Gameplay  

### Mechanics  
The player will have to make choices in how the harvest and spend their accumulated resources in order to create a steady
economy and expand their empire. The game leverages the Achievement mechanic to award a sense of progress. The next upgrade will always be right around the corner for the player- all they need to do is conintue with their momentum of harvesting resources and being "blissfully productive".   

The economy can be summarized into four main categories: Hosts, Minions, Currency, and Mutations. At the start of the game, the player will simply be gathering one currency- nutrients- from a single host. However, nutrients can be spent on producing more minions (at the lowest stage, this will be nutrient-sucking ticks). Eventually, the player will need to attach to new hosts because individual hosts have a maximum parasite capacity. Taking over a new host will use minions as a form of currency- for example, capturing a new rat might cost 50 ticks due to the resistance the host puts up to oncoming parasites.

In a similar vein, hosts themselves can be sacrificed for a new form of currency, protien. Protien will be used in conjuction with nutrients to purchase mutations, which are essentially modifiers to the species' ability to attack hosts, harvest nutrients, and reproduce. Mutations will be relatively costly and will be upgradable multiple times for even bigger benefits.

### Controls  
This game will be controlled exclusively with the mouse. Most of the game will be clicking on buttons and navigating
various menus, or directing a graphical representation of your minnions on screen. 

### Onboarding  
The player will be presented with a very simple menu interface with only one option- click a button to harvest nutrients from the host.
After the player has harvested enough nutrients, a new menu option to spawn a minion will appear. The player will see a graphical representation of their progress as they gather resources and produce more minnions- their newly spawned minions will appear next to them, and clicking to harvest nutrients will cause both the player character and the minions to harvest nutrients. This progression will be based on cascading information theory; new upgrades, choices, and information will be presented to the player only as they are unlocked and become relevant to progression. This way, the player will always have an obvious "next action" to work toward, and teaching the game will be baked right into its presentation.

### Player Learning
In order to be successful in *Queen*, the player needs to make decisions on building their economy and upgrading their species. There isn't necesarily a way to lose in this game, but progression towards end-game of assimilating the whole planet will take inefficient players much longer to accomplish.

### Screenshots  
I'll definitely get these up soon.

### Other  
Hm. I'm not sure what to put here.
