# Queen  

## High Concept
As Queen of The Hive, wield total control over your minions as you build your empire and assimilate the
planet; It is good to be Queen.

## Genre
*Queen* is a cross between an idle game and a simmulation. Think *Clicker Heroes* meets
building an economy as the Zerg from *StarCraft*.

## Platform  
This game will be designed for web browsers on desktop computers.

## Story  
As the Queen of a hive-mind species, your goal is to grow your horde of minions and dominate the planet,
either wiping-out or assimilating other life forms on your conquest.  

The player will feel the power of commanding a large force of minions as they lead a seemingly-unstoppable
force of parasites to planetary domination. *Queen* will aim to insinuate the feeling of power-lust into its
players. After all, the goal of most idle games is to keep growing your economy and your power to increasingly
absurd heights.  

However, *Queen* will also show the effects of your conquest through minute story events that are triggered as
the player progresses and reaches new milestones. For example, when you have enough resources and minion to attempt
a hostile takeover of a whole town, descriptive messages about how people resist you or beg for mercy will appear.
Ideally, the player will enjoy the power they gain, but begin to question their own morality.  

## Esthetics  
Still working on this one.

## Gameplay  

### Mechanics  
The player will have to make choices in how the harvest and spend their accumulated resources in order to create a steady
economy and expand their empire. The game leverages the Achievement mechanic to award a sense of progress. This game will
also leverage the principles of Behavioural Momentum and Blissful Productivity.

### Controls  
This game will be controlled exclusively with the mouse. Most of the game will be clicking on buttons and navigating
various menus, or directing a graphical representation of your minnions on screen. 

### Onboarding  
The player will be presented with a very simple menu interface with only one option- click a button to harvest nutrients from a host.
After the player has harvested enough nutrients, a new menu option to spawn a minion will appear. The player will see a graphical representation of their progress as they gather resources and produce more minnions.

### Player Learning
The player will learn about the game through cascading information. As more resources are gathered and the player can afford new upgrades,
they become available. By following this model, players will only learn about new options and upgrades as they become available.  
The game's economy will feature three major elements: Currency, Hosts, and Structures.

### Screenshots  
I'll definitely get these up soon.

### Other  
Hm. I'm not sure what to put here.
