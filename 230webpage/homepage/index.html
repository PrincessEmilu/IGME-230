                You've reached Emily Horton's super cool homepage, which was designed for her IGME 230 class. 
                Here you will find a bit of information about myself, as well as links to various projects that I've worked on.

        <p class="blocktext">
                I am transfer student from Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3) located in my hometown of Dryden, New York.
                Currently, I am studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I came to RIT in order to complete
                a 4-year degree after taking several years off from schooling. I hope that I can make meaningful connections, learn valuable skills, 
                and ultimately find a job in the tech industry in either game development or software development.
                My interests include video games (of course), music, hiking, reading, hanging out with my friends.... 
                and a lot more! I'm into a little bit of everything to be honest. I want to enjoy life and not end up with any regrets when I die.
        </p>
